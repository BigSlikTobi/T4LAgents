3. Create a short 2-4 Words statement headline (for example: "Rogers and the Viks" or "Ravens Kicker drama")for every article in the content. If 2 articles have the same date combine them under one Headline.

Output: Provide the result in a cleaned json in the following format:

{
  "ClusterId": [
    {   articlid,
        headline,
        DATE
    },
    {   articlid,
        headline,
        DATE
    },
    {   articlid,
        headline,
        DATE
    }   
  ]
}
